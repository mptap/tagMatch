Checking Tags In An HTML File

Ms. Manjiri Tapaswi &

If you are creating a web page using an ordinary text editor, you are required to check the correctness of HTML tags. 
This C program quickly checks several major tags in your HTML file, by ensuring that they are in correct order, 
and each tag has its corresponding closing tag.
